# The University of Chicago

The University of Chicago harbors a large number of researchers who are excellent collaborators and sources of inspiration for the work in the Novembre Lab.  We interact most regularly with faculty in the departments of [Human Genetics](http://hgen.uchicago.edu), [Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu), [Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu), and the [section of Genetic Medicine in the Department of Medicine](https://medicine.uchicago.edu/sections/genetic-medicine/).  

Locally, the Novembre Lab is situated on the fourth floor of the Cummings Life Sciences building, shared with the groups of [Jeremy Berg](jjpopgen.org), [Anna Di Rienzo](http://genapps.uchicago.edu/newlabweb/index.html), [Xin He](xinhelab.org), [Maanasa Raghavan](genscape-lab.org), [Matthew Stephens](stephenslab.uchicago.edu).  We run a weekly Mathematical PopGen meeting with the groups of Jeremy Berg and [Matthias Steinrucken](https://voices.uchicago.edu/steinrueckenlab/).  Further, with the Berg, He, and Stephens labs we continue the tradition of a long-running Friday morning "super-group" meeting, where we often also have in attendance members of the groups of Andy Dahl, Haky Im, Yang Li, Xuanyao Liu, Lixing Yang, and others.  

The [Research Computing Center](rcc.uchicago.edu) and [Center for Research Informatics](cri.uchicago.edu) support our computational efforts by providing access to computing clusters, providing short courses on topics in scientific computing, and staff assistance with technical challenges.

The Biological Sciences Division runs the [qBio  Quantitative  "bootcamp"](https://jnovembre.github.io/BSD-QBio6/) for incoming graduate students (for which John has become a co-director starting in 2020), and we have a [curricular track for computational biology](https://compbio.uchicago.edu/curriculum/) for PhD students in Human Genetics and Genetics, Genomics, and Systems Biology.

Our trainees also benefit from several unique resources and groups such as: [GRIT](https://voices.uchicago.edu/grit/), [myChoice](http://www.mychoice.uchicago.edu),  [GRADTalk](https://grad.uchicago.edu/academic-support/gradtalk/), [Hack Arts Lab (HAL) and the Media Arts, Data and Design (MADD) Center](https://arts.uchicago.edu/explore/initiatives/media-arts-data-and-design-center-madd-center/hack-arts-lab-hal), and the [Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu).

The city sits at the boundary of two major watersheds and was important as a canoe portage point between waters that flow to the Atlantic through the St Lawrence seaway versus those that flow through the Mississippi.  As such it was a major region of trade as part of its role in the traditional lands for the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations.  Ecologically, the region is a borderland, with marsh, coastal dune, northern hardwood, tall grass prairie, and savannah biomes all represented.  Southern Lake Michigan is also a major flyway for migratory birds, and spring and fall migrations are easy to appreciate in the local parks.  Aldo Leopold's classic of nature writing, A Sand County Almanac, was written 3 hours drive north of the city.  Here are some destinations we enjoy outside the city:

- [Starved Rock State Park](https://www.starvedrocklodge.com/starved-rock-state-park/)
