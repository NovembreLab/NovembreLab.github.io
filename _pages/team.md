# Alumni
 After more than ten years now as a lab, we have an even spread of alumni that have gone into academics and industry. Thus far, geographically our alumni can be found in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Switzerland, and Germany.  While we work in a university setting and train ourselves in the practice of research and teaching, this prepares our alumni for a broad set of careers.
