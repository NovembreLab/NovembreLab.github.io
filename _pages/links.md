### Genetic Information Non-Discrimination and Privacy Protections
Here is a set of links for gaining more background on the topic of genetic non-discrimination and privacy collected by John in the period of 2018-2019.  This list is focused on the recent history in the United States, and in particular focuses on understanding the 2008 Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act and state-level laws that have been proposed or passed since GINA.  Recommended updates are very welcome, and please email John (jnovembre at uchicago dot edu) with your suggestions.
