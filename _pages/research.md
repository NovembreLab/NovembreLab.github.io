# Research

Our goal is to develop widely used statistical methods for intelligently extracting information from large-scale genomic data with the aim to improve understanding of: (1) basic genomic biology, (2) the biology of heritable disease traits, (3) the genetic basis of evolutionary processes, and (4) the history and evolution of various species, especially humans.

## Population Genetics Methods and Theory

  * Methods for studying and visualizing population structure

  * Haplotype-based methods for inference in population genetics

  * The impact of population structure on genome-wide association studies and methods to correct for the effects of population structure

  * Inference of the relative strength of selection and dispersal based on the geographic spread of advantageous alleles

## Human Population Genetics

 * Patterns of population structure in human populations especially within world regions and finer spatial-scales

 * The impact of recent demographic processes, particularly rapid recent growth, on human genetics

 * The interaction of selection and demographic history in human evolutionary history

 * Correcting for population structure in human genome-wide association studies

 * Personalized genomics: Inference of detailed individual ancestry from genetic data

 * The insights that can be gained from studies of human ancient DNA



## Canid Population Genetics

In collaboration with Bob Wayne and the larger CanMap project:

 * The genetic basis of adaptive evolution during early dog domestication from grey wolves

 * The demographic history of early dog domestication

 * Population structure and signatures of selection among arctic wolf ecotypes (e.g. tundra vs. taiga forms)


# Training Goals

Beyond our research goals, we have the following training and outreach aims:

  * Train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the interdisciplinary skills necessary to make independent, insightful contributions to contemporary research problems in human genetics and evolutionary biology.
  * Develop teaching materials and courses to help: (1) prepare a new generation of biologist that will need strong skills in quantitative reasoning and computation to address the vast amounts of data now readily available; (2) prepare future citizens who are well-informed and capable of sound decision-making in a world in which science and particularly genetics will play an increasingly important role for society.
  * Promote international collaborative experiences for students to help foster individual growth and to strengthen scientific institutions and training programs through exchange.



<!-- Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high?

Currently, our instrument of choice  is SI-STM.  State-of-the-art SI-STM measures an array of tunneling spectra on a given sample, registered to the atomic sites with picometer precision. Each is proportional to the local density of states at a given location. Ideally, the recorded spectra are so tightly packed that the measurement yields a three-dimensional mapping of the local density of states as a function of locations and energy. This is shown on the image on the right-hand side (10x10 nm2), and its Fourier transform, below.

The quantum materials which we will investigate encapsulate some of the great unsolved mysteries of physics. They include high-temperature superconductors, quantum-critical compounds, graphene, and topological electronic matter that can be used for error-resistant quantum computing.
