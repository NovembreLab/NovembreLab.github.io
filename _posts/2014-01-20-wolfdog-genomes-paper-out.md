This last week we had our work on using wolf and dog genomes to understand dog domestication go to press!

Here's a set of the relevant links to read more in depth:

* [The main paper in PLoS Genetics]("http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004016;jsessionid=74FB84F5F2972AB43BDA3677EFA17580")

* [A nice paired perspective piece "How much is that in dog years" in PLoS Genetics from Greger Larson and Dan Brady]("http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004093")

* [A great post from Ilan Gronau on how the multiple methods we used helped illuminate an overall picture of dog domestication]("http://haldanessieve.org/2014/01/17/author-post-genome-sequencing-highlights-the-dynamic-early-history-of-dogs/")

And a big thanks to all the great researchers who contributed to this project, especially my former postdoc Adam Freedman who was first author on the project and colleague Robert Wayne who was the co-senior author with me.
