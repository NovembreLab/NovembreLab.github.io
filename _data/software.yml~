  desc: A program that calculates a codon usage bias summary statistic, Ncâ€™. It is based on the effective number of codons statistic Nc (or ENC) developed by Frank Wright, but improves upon it by accounting for background nucleotide composition.

  desc: A program that uses a coalescent framework to simulate the evolution of multiple haploid populations with complex demographies . Developed by Laurent Excoffier and Stefan Schnieder with some contributions from JN. NOTE- A new version, [fastSIMCOAL2](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal2/), is now available.
