  abstract: Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor
    in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus
    genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population
    stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based
    approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented
    in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than
    model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT
    has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to
    structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based
    estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood
    model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving
    problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we
    have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements
    of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic
    programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration
    of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than
    the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated
    in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE’s maximum likelihood
    estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies
    are as accurate as structure’s Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE’s
    estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken
    together, our results show that ADMIXTURE’s computational speed opens up the possibility
    of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that
    its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification
    in association studies.

  abstract: Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in recent human evolution,
    including results from genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals at
    candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human
    Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively
    selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele
    frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across
    the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively
    selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified
    using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly
    few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly
    fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred
    outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection
    is often weak enough that neutral processes – especially population history, migration,
    and drift – exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution
    of selected alleles.

  abstract: 'Molecular Anthropology is a relatively young field of research. In
    fact, less than 50 years have passed since the symposium “Classification and Human
    Evolution” (1962, Burg Wartenstein, Austria), where the term was formally introduced
    by Emil Zuckerkandl. In this time, Molecular Anthropology has developed both methodologically
    and theoretically and extended its applications, so covering key aspects of human
    evolution such as the reconstruction of the history of human populations and peopling
    processes, the characterization of DNA in extinct humans and the role of adaptive
    processes in shaping the genetic diversity of our species. In the current scientific
    panorama, molecular anthropologists have to face a double challenge. As members
    of the anthropological community, we are strongly committed to the integration
    of biological findings and other lines of evidence (e.g. linguistic and archaeological),
    while keeping in line with methodological innovations which are moving the approach
    from the genetic to the genomic level. In this framework, the meeting “DNA Polymorphisms
    in Human Populations: Molecular Anthropology in the Genomic Era” (Rome, December
    3-5, 2009) offered an opportunity for discussion among scholars from different
    disciplines, while paying attention to the impact of recent methodological innovations.
    Here we present an overview of the meeting and discuss perspectives and prospects
    of Molecular Anthropology in the genomic era.'

  container-title: Mol Biol Evol
  page: '1257-68'
  volume: '27'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: In a series of highly influential publications, Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues
    used principal component (PC) analysis to produce maps depicting how human genetic
    diversity varies across geographic space. Within Europe, the first axis of variation
    (PC1) was interpreted as evidence for the demic diffusion model of agriculture,
    in which farmers expanded from the Near East approximately 10,000 years ago and
    replaced the resident hunter-gatherer populations with little or no interbreeding.
    These interpretations of the PC maps have been recently questioned as the original
    results can be reproduced under models of spatially covarying allele frequencies
    without any expansion. Here, we study PC maps for data simulated under models
    of range expansion and admixture. Our simulations include a spatially realistic
    model of Neolithic farmer expansion and assume various levels of interbreeding
    between farmer and resident hunter-gatherer populations. An important result is
    that under a broad range of conditions, the gradients in PC1 maps are oriented
    along a direction perpendicular to the axis of the expansion, rather than along
    the same axis as the expansion. We propose that this surprising pattern is an
    outcome of the “allele surfing” phenomenon, which creates sectors of high allele-frequency
    differentiation that align perpendicular to the direction of the expansion.

  abstract: Technological and scientific advances, stemming in large part from the
    Human Genome and HapMap projects, have made large-scale, genome-wide investigations
    feasible and cost effective. These advances have the potential to dramatically
    impact drug discovery and development by identifying genetic factors that contribute
    to variation in disease risk as well as drug pharmacokinetics, treatment efficacy,
    and adverse drug reactions. In spite of the technological advancements, successful
    application in biomedical research would be limited without access to suitable
    sample collections. To facilitate exploratory genetics research, we have assembled
    a DNA resource from a large number of subjects participating in multiple studies
    throughout the world. This growing resource was initially genotyped with a commercially
    available genome-wide 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism panel. This project
    includes nearly 6,000 subjects of African-American, East Asian, South Asian, Mexican,
    and European origin. Seven informative axes of variation identified via principal-component
    analysis (PCA) of these data confirm the overall integrity of the data and highlight
    important features of the genetic structure of diverse populations. The potential
    value of such extensively genotyped collections is illustrated by selection of
    genetically matched population controls in a genome-wide analysis of abacavir-associated
    hypersensitivity reaction. We find that matching based on country of origin, identity-by-state
    distance, and multidimensional PCA do similarly well to control the type I error
    rate. The genotype and demographic data from this reference sample are freely
    available through the NCBI database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

  abstract: Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental
    interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high-throughput
    genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns
    of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover
    variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation
    in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable
    DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation
    among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic
    distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient
    two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize
    that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations
    can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the
    results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual’s
    DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often
    to within a few hundred kilometres.

  abstract: Nearly 30 years ago, Cavalli-Sforza et al. pioneered the use of principal
    component analysis (PCA) in population genetics and used PCA to produce maps summarizing
    human genetic variation across continental regions. They interpreted gradient
    and wave patterns in these maps as signatures of specific migration events. These
    interpretations have been controversial, but influential, and the use of PCA has
    become widespread in analysis of population genetics data. However, the behavior
    of PCA for genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, such as might exist
    within human continental groups, has been less well characterized. Here, we find
    that gradients and waves observed in Cavalli-Sforza et al.’s maps resemble sinusoidal
    mathematical artifacts that arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data,
    implying that the patterns do not necessarily reflect specific migration events.
    Our findings aid interpretation of PCA results and suggest how PCA can help correct
    for continuous population structure in association studies.

  container-title: Evolution
  page: '2914-25'
  volume: '63'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Estimating dispersal distances from population genetic data provides an
    important alternative to logistically taxing methods for directly observing dispersal.
    Although methods for estimating dispersal rates between a modest number of discrete
    demes are well developed, methods of inference applicable to “isolation-by-distance”
    models are much less established. Here, we present a method for estimating rhosigma(2),
    the product of population density (rho) and the variance of the dispersal displacement
    distribution (sigma(2)). The method is based on the assumption that low-frequency
    alleles are identical by descent. Hence, the extent of geographic clustering of
    such alleles, relative to their frequency in the population, provides information
    about rhosigma(2). We show that a novel likelihood-based method can infer this
    composite parameter with a modest bias in a lattice model of isolation-by-distance.
    For calculating the likelihood, we use an importance sampling approach to average
    over the unobserved intraallelic genealogies, where the intraallelic genealogies
    are modeled as a pure birth process. The approach also leads to a likelihood-ratio
    test of isotropy of dispersal, that is, whether dispersal distances on two axes
    are different. We test the performance of our methods using simulations of new
    mutations in a lattice model and illustrate its use with a dataset from Arabidopsis
    thaliana.

  volume: '12'
  abstract: Human groups show structured levels of genetic similarity as a consequence
    of factors such as geographical subdivision and genetic drift. Surveying this
    structure gives us a scientific perspective on human origins, sheds light on evolutionary
    processes that shape both human adaptation and disease, and is integral to effectively
    carrying out the mission of global medical genetics and personalized medicine.
    Surveys of population structure have been ongoing for decades, but in the past
    three years, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) array technology has provided
    unprecedented detail on human population structure at global and regional scales.
    These studies have confirmed well-known relationships between distantly related
    populations and uncovered previously unresolvable relationships among closely
    related human groups. SNPs represent the first dense genome-wide markers, and
    as such, their analysis has raised many challenges and insights relevant to the
    study of population genetics with whole-genome sequences. Here we draw on the
    lessons from these studies to anticipate the directions that will be most fruitful
    to pursue during the emerging whole-genome sequencing era.

  abstract: Empowered by technology and sampling efforts designed to facilitate genome-wide

    variation in unprecedented detail. With high genomic coverage and geographic resolution,
    these studies are identifying loci with spatial signatures of selection, such
    as extreme levels of differentiation and correlations with environmental variables.
    Collectively, patterns at these loci are beginning to provide new insights into
    the process of human adaptation. Here, we review the challenges of these studies
    and emerging results, including how human population structure has influenced
    the response to novel selective pressures.

  abstract: Genome-wide scans for recent positive selection in humans have yielded
    insight into the mechanisms underlying the extensive phenotypic diversity in our
    species, but have focused on a limited number of populations. Here, we present
    an analysis of recent selection in a global sample of 53 populations, using genotype
    data from the Human Genome Diversity-CEPH Panel. We refine the geographic distributions
    of known selective sweeps, and find extensive overlap between these distributions
    for populations in the same continental region but limited overlap between populations
    outside these groupings. We present several examples of previously unrecognized
    candidate targets of selection, including signals at a number of genes in the
    NRG-ERBB4 developmental pathway in non-African populations. Analysis of recently
    identified genes involved in complex diseases suggests that there has been selection
    on loci involved in susceptibility to type II diabetes. Finally, we search for
    local adaptation between geographically close populations, and highlight several
    examples.

  page: '725-31'
  volume: '44'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Characterizing genetic diversity within and between populations has broad
    applications in studies of human disease and evolution. We propose a new approach,
    spatial ancestry analysis, for the modeling of genotypes in two- or three-dimensional
    space. In spatial ancestry analysis (SPA), we explicitly model the spatial distribution
    of each SNP by assigning an allele frequency as a continuous function in geographic
    space. We show that the explicit modeling of the allele frequency allows individuals
    to be localized on the map on the basis of their genetic information alone. We
    apply our SPA method to a European and a worldwide population genetic variation
    data set and identify SNPs showing large gradients in allele frequency, and we
    suggest these as candidate regions under selection. These regions include SNPs
    in the well-characterized LCT region, as well as at loci including FOXP2, OCA2
    and LRP1B.
