  blurb: "I got my start in this field through a combination of enjoying computer programming as a hobby and thinking about evolution as one of the world's most fascinating natural processes.  Now, my main research tackles statistical and theoretical problems to help enable discoveries about evolutionary processes and the nature of disease variation. Much of that work is in the context of human genetic variation, which is doubly fascinating because of the connections to fields like linguistics, archaeology, and history.  For my training, I earned my undergrad degree in biochemistry at the Colorado College, studied for my PhD in Integrative Biology (with a designated emphasis in Computational Biology & Genomics) at UC-Berkeley under Montgomery Slatkin, and did a  postdoc in Human Genetics at Chicago with Matthew Stephens.  My first faculty position was in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at UCLA and then I returned to the University of Chicago in 2013.  Outside of my work I enjoy travel, music, and a variety of different outdoor sports."

  info: PhD Student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology Program
  blurb: "Xinyi is interested in studying natural selection and the evolution of complex traits to increase our understanding on disease mechanism, especially immune traits. Prior to joining the lab, Xinyi worked on statistical method development for estimating disease heritability in admixed populations."

  blurb: "Maggie is interested in studying spatial processes in evolution and impacts on human disease traits. Her current research focuses on the impact of geographic sampling and dispersal on rare variant ascertainment and models for the spatial spread of adaptive alleles. Prior to joining the lab, she graduated from George Washington University with a BS in Mathematics and studied evolutionary genomics in retroviruses."
