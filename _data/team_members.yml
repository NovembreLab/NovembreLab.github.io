  blurb: "I got my start in this field through a combination of enjoying computer programming as a hobby and thinking about evolution as one of the world's most fascinating natural processes.  Now, my main research tackles statistical and theoretical problems to help enable discoveries about evolutionary processes and the nature of disease variation. Much of that work is in the context of human genetic variation, which is doubly fascinating because of the connections to fields like linguistics, archaeology, and history.  For my training, I earned my undergrad degree in biochemistry at the Colorado College, studied for my PhD with a designated emphasis in Computational Biology & Genomics at UC-Berkeley under Montgomery Slatkin, and did a short postdoc in Human Genetics at Chicago with Matthew Stephens.  Previous to my faculty post at UChicago, I was faculty in the Ecology and Evolution Department at UCLA.  Outside of my work I greatly enjoy travel, music, and outdoor adventures."

  info: Postdoctoral Fellow
  blurb: "[Daniel Rice](https://dp-rice.github.io/) is a postdoctoral fellow in the [Chicago Fellows Program](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/page/chicago-fellows).  He previously completed a PhD in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University where he studied with Michael Desai.  He has worked on problems arising in the analysis of experimental evolution data as well as core issues in theoretical population genetics, such as evolution of the distribution of fitness effects and signatures of multi-merger coalescence."

  info: Postdoctoral Fellow
  blurb: "[Harald Ringbauer](https://ist.ac.at/research-groups-pages/barton-group/team/alumni/harald-ringbauer/) is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab. His work focuses on the development of methods to estimate current population structure from genetic data, especially using identity-by-descent tract data. Direct observations to infer demography are often very cumbersome, but the advent of population genomic datasets has opened a lot of new opportunities for this discipline, and Harald works on innovative ways to utilize these. Before joining the Novembre lab, he completed a PhD at IST Austria, supervised by [Nick Barton](https://ist.ac.at/research/research-groups/barton-group/) ."

  info: PhD Student
  blurb: "[Arjun](https://aabiddanda.github.io/) is a PhD student in the Department of Human Genetics. His work largely focuses on methods development for inference with both spatial and temporally structured genetic data, such as ancient DNA. Currently, his specific topics of interest are in the geographic distribution of functional genetic variants and multi-locus models with temporal structured samples. Prior to joining the lab, Arjun worked on the population genetics of Indian Jewish populations and methods for X-based GWAS"

  blurb: "Maryn is a PhD student in the Committee of Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology. Broadly, she is interested in understanding how selection acts on and shapes the genetic architecture of complex traits. Prior to joining the lab, Maryn studied the genetics of a plant pathogen as well as plant quantitative genetics at Cornell University."

  blurb: "Joe is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and PhD student in the Department of Human Genetics. His primary interest is in developing and applying statistical methods with applications to genomic data. He first joined the lab as an intern and programmer where he worked extensively on the [Geography of Genetic Variants Browser](https://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/) as well as our collaboration with the SardiNIA/Progenia project. Currently, Joeâ€™s main projects include the analysis of a large-scale ancient DNA dataset from Sardinia and the development of a statistical method to visualize spatial heterogeneity."

  blurb: "Chi-Chun works as the bioinformatician in the lab. He is interested in the inference of demography and selection using ancient DNA, and has been working on our collaboration of high-altitude adaptation with the Di Rienzo lab. Chi-Chun previously worked on local ancestry methods and was advised by Dan Nicolae for his M.S. degree in Statistcs at the University of Chicago."
